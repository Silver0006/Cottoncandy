##Plan
1. Write functions to make interactions with windows registry easier
2. Replicate functionality of powershell script in c++
3. Expand to Linux
4. Create tui(something like ncurses). Basically a tui settings menu that is somewhere between cli and gui to simplify settings on Linux distro's with no desktop. Also include explanations of each setting and how to accomplish them in cli. Mix between learning tool and simplifying administrative work.
5. Add ability to save and load presets.
